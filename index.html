  <br><br>
	 This volume of texts for the <i>IJAL</i> series Texts in Indigenous Languages of the Americas offers 18 different texts in the Kiowa language, glossed and translated, which trace the historic journey from the pre-reservation life into the modern Westernized era.  The texts present a uniquely Kiowa perspective on this transition, its ups and downs, and exemplifies the wit, humor, and dedication to memory of Kiowa storytelling. Each text is accompanied by an introduction that situates it in Kiowa history and culture.

<div class="panel">
  <p style = "font-size:10pt;"> 
	  
	  This volume is a theory-driven documentation of the semantics and pragmatics of Kiowa. It will fill in gaps that have emerged in our understanding due to advances in formal semantics over the last few decades.  The volume is organized along the lines of semantic concepts, rather than the forms and structures.  While being driven and founded upon formal concepts, the volume will focus on concepts of meaning, and applying tests for truth-conditions and felicity. This book will be the first document of its kind, focusing on the semantics of a single language, and hopefully will lead to proper semantic typology and offer data for deeper theoretical understanding. It is also intended serve as a model for fieldworkers who are not experts in semantics, so they can apply these tests and discover similar facts about the languages they research.  It is under contract with Oxford University Press.

Interestingly, this thought experiment allows one to explore the fundamental nature of meaning, the limits to observation, and the role that ontology plays in organizing lingusitic meaning and perhaps thought.

	 If we sent a vessel on a multi-generation space journey, what might happen to the language on board? How might it change, especially as the vessel maintained less and less contact with Earth? We are necessarily speculative, but draw inspiration from Earthbound examples of isolated long-distance voyages. This paper contributes to the European Space Agency's Advanced Concepts Team's discussion on issues that may arise during interstellar travel.</p>

  <br> In this talk we quickly lay out some of the issues with ambiguity in the operating room. We show some neat videos of surgeons in action (not too gory), and highlight just how well people are at filling in gaps in meaning. Sadly, the LSA's video vendor slapped a one-year embargo on the presentations, so you can't watch the video yet.

  <br>
  In this talk I argue that the unspoken semantic content is the key component of understanding what polsynthetic processes are about.  Speakers use polysynthesis to say more while building less. We can organize polysynthetic processes by their semantic effects, and see that they involve the verbal projection doing the work of functional heads like determiners or adpositions, etc. The unspoken meaning is nebulous, which explains a number of key cross-linguistic facts about incorporation.  Nebulosity makes polysynthetic structures easier to build but harder to interpret. The cost is mitigated by cultural and grammatical factors.  Finally, I point out that these semantic processes are common cross-linguistically even in 'non-polysynthetic' phenomena, showing that the foundations of polysynthesis abound in natural language. <p>

  <br>
	This talk brings together my work on noun and verb incorporation in Kiowa. It argues that to understand the meaning of incorporation, we have to employ some kind of mediating relations to supply the functional meanings that are missing in the visible structure. By including these relations and the heads that introduce them, we open up new ways to understand how incorporation can affect argument structure.</p>

  <br>
  Resolves two elements of weak compositionality in noun incorporation in one stroke.  NI either involves non-objects (knife+cut) which are quantified over but whose relation to the verb is vague, or objects (meat+cut) whose relation is clear but whose entity argument is not saturated in a satsifactory way.  Looking at Kiowa NI and English synthetic compounds, I show that these issues are both resolved if noun incorporation requires a mediating relation, which is independently needed in many cases. This relation provides a thematic role when required, and binds the entity argument, along with world and event arguments when the meaning requires.  Object incorporation requires a mediating relation above the verb, provided by a derivational or light-verb head not in the inflectional projection.  </p>

			<p style = "font-size:10pt; border-bottom: dotted black 0.2pt; border-right-radius:10pt;"> I examine switch-reference (SR) in Kiowa, and argue that it is sensitive to the topic situation and dependent on the configuration of the clause juncture. With coordination, SR tracks topic situations, while with subordinating clauses that lack topic situations, it tracks subjects.

    We demonstrate that the English adverbial <em>almost</em> requires a modal in addition to scalar proximity. The modal involves the same Non-Interrupting ordering source that Portner finds in the progressive.  If the event and its circumstances allow the event to proceed to completion in normal relevant counterparts to the topic situation, <em>almost</em> can apply `at a distance'.  In cases where that isn't possible, notably in statives, present tense eventives, and cases where the evaluation is based on the result rather than the process, <em>almost</em> requires most of the necessary conditions to be complete.</p>

  Employs semantic fieldwork techniques to argue that the auxiliary construction <i>-(I)p bol-</i> in the Turkic language Uyghur (and <i>-(i)b bo'l-</i> in Uzbek) is actually two constructions: The first asserts that the event relation is homomorphic, which leads to a sense of 'full completion.' The second, previously unattested in the literature, conventionally implicates that the event relation satisifies the content of some known content-bearing object. This paper promises a new line of research and offers suggestions for deep discoveries concerning Turkic auxiliaries and auxiliaries cross-linguistically.</p>

	  <p style="font-size:10pt;">Evidentials are curiously limited as to what types of evidence they mark. I propose that this limit stems from how situation semantics affects language acquisition. Essentially, the kinds of situations that lead to lexical acquisition in infants and children are precisely the kinds that turn up in evidential systems. This suggests a link between the language acquisition device and the grammar itself.</p>
